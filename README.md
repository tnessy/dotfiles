# Dotfiles
This is my WIP backup for configuration used for my current Linux workstation.
Primarily the colorscheme is based on Ayu Dark but there are some inconsistencies that I'm working out.

# Configuration
Base OS: EndeavorOS (Arch Linux)
WM: i3-gaps-rounded (Fork of i3-gaps => fork of i3)
Terminal: Kitty
Shell: zsh
Bar: Polybar
Font: Caskaydia Cove (w/ Nerd Font)

# Notes
This configuration is built for a triple monitor setup, so there may be some keybinds that don't make sense for single or dual monitors.
